# React Starter

This repository serves as a beginner's guide to developing web applications with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It includes setup instructions, core concepts, and a simple example application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine

## Installation

1. **Create a new React application**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Core Concepts

1. **JSX** - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended for use with React to describe what the UI should look like.

2. **Components** - React builds the UI using components. You can think of components as custom, reusable HTML elements.

3. **Props** - Short for properties, props are a way of passing data from parent to child components.

4. **State** - State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

## Example - A Simple Counter

This example creates a simple counter that increases, decreases, or resets based on user input.

### `Counter.js`

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrease</button>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Integrating the Counter

Add the `Counter` component to your `App.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Counter from './Counter';

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Counter />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
